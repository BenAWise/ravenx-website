Jen/RavenX CONTENT STRATEGY
Your content will center on revenue acceleration for growth-stage and enterprise companies. Specifically, the leadership mindset, team dynamics, and execution discipline required to break through revenue plateaus and unlock the next level of growth. You're not a theorist. You've built revenue organizations from the ground up, taken companies public, and closed Fortune 100 deals yourself. Your content reflects that: practical, battle-tested, and grounded in what actually works when the stakes are high.

The 6 C's / Multiplier Mindset — Should these frameworks be prominently featured in your content (potentially as a recurring series) or kept more proprietary for clients?

Industry Specificity — You mentioned media and healthcare as your strongest verticals, but you don't want to niche too hard. Should we weave in industry-specific examples occasionally to signal credibility in those spaces, or stay fully horizontal?

Differentiators
1. Player-Coach, Not Armchair Consultant
Most revenue consultants advise from the sidelines. You've actually done the work—built teams, closed multi-million dollar deals with the Fortune 100, and led organizations through IPOs. When you coach a sales leader on a high-stakes negotiation, you're drawing on decades of doing it yourself. This "player-coach" credibility is rare and gives your POV real weight.
2. You Stay for Execution—Then Leave Them Stronger
The big consulting firms either drop a deck and disappear, or embed themselves to become indispensable. You do neither. You stay through the messy execution phase—6 to 9 months, side-by-side with leadership—but the goal is to make yourself unnecessary. You teach the team to fish. When you leave, they're 10x better than when you arrived.

3. Proven, Repeatable Frameworks
Your 5P/10P Diagnostic (Product, Pitch, People, Pipeline, etc.) and 6 C's sales methodology aren't theoretical—they're the same systems used to drive $35M in new revenue for Axel Springer, turn around seven consecutive missed quarters at TripAdvisor, and help clients consistently exceed targets by $40M+ in a single year. Frameworks that scale.

You're not trying to impress—you're trying to help
Storytelling is grounded and specific, not abstract
You can be vulnerable about failures/lessons without being self-deprecating

Content Goals
Establish thought leadership among CEOs, Presidents, and C-suite executives responsible for revenue
Demonstrate credibility through specific stories, results, and frameworks—not vague claims
Attract inbound inquiries from companies at revenue inflection points ($50M+)
Differentiate from McKinsey/Bain types by showing you stay for execution and have actually done the work
Build trust with PE firms and board members who influence hiring decisions
ICP 
Your ICP is C-suite executives at companies with $50M+ in revenue who are facing a revenue inflection point—either a major growth opportunity they need help capitalizing on, or a revenue problem they need to turn around. They've often tried solving it internally or with other consultants, and it hasn't worked.

Persona 1: The Growth-Mandate CEO
CEO or President of a $50M-$500M company (often PE-backed or recently acquired) with aggressive revenue targets. They know where they need to go but don't have the internal bench to get there. They're looking for someone who can come in, uplevel the team, and actually execute—not just advise.

Persona 2: The Turnaround Leader
CEO, President, or CRO at a company that's been missing numbers—sometimes for multiple quarters. The board is asking questions. They've tried internal fixes. They need someone who's seen this movie before and knows how to change the trajectory fast.

Persona 3: The PE Operating Partner / Board Member
Responsible for driving value creation across a portfolio. Looking for trusted operators who can parachute into portfolio companies, diagnose issues quickly, and drive EBITDA improvement. Values speed, credibility, and a track record with recognizable logos.

Content North Star 
"Ignite the thinking that ignites the revenue."

Every post should either (a) shift how a leader thinks about a revenue challenge, or (b) give them a concrete tool/framework to act on. The goal is to be the voice in their head when they're stuck; the trusted counsel they wish they had in the room.
